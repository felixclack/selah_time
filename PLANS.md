# Planning with the Codex CLI

This repo uses a short, explicit plan for any non-trivial task. Plans are meant to be easy to check off and easy to verify.

## Step granularity
- Make steps large enough to be meaningful, but small enough to complete in one focused pass.
- Set all steps before starting the work.
- Each step should have a clear, checkable outcome.

## Making steps verifiable
- Use outcomes with concrete results (files changed, tests run, outputs produced).
- Avoid vague phrasing like “refactor” or “improve” without stating what “done” looks like.

## Defining task boundaries
- Be explicit about what is in-scope vs. out-of-scope.
- If helpful, list assumptions or constraints.

## Plan updates
- Update the plan as you complete each step.
- If a new step is required, add it instead of overwriting prior intent.
- Keep completed steps visible to show progress.

## Plan template
```
## Plan
- [ ] Step 1: ...
- [ ] Step 2: ...
- [ ] Step 3: ...

## Notes
- Assumptions, risks, or out-of-scope items.
